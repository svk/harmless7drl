Harmless7DRL is a rogue-like game. As is conventional in the genre, the\
 letters and symbols on the main screen represent a top-down view of\
 a dungeon level. The player character is the green @.\

Letters in general represent monsters. Hashes (#) are walls, and periods (.) are floor tiles.\
 Most dungeon levels contain stairs down (>) and stairs up (<). Boulders\
 (0) are scattered around the dungeon. Other symbols usually represent\
 items. Floor tiles highlighted with a red background indicate that your\
 character has noticed a trap trigger. You can press the "look" key, ':',\
 to enter look mode, allowing you  to get a description of any visible tile\
 by placing your cursor over it. (The cursor is controlled with the same keys\
 as the player character.  You can exit look-mode by pressing space or Enter.)\
\n
In a roguelike, when a character dies the game is permanently over.\
 It is not intended that you reload after a lost game -- instead,\
 start over with a new character. For this reason, there is no need\
