To cast a spell, you first need to construct it from its runes.
The names of the runes are scrambled. To be able to use a rune
in construction, you need to "learn" it which is how the player
progresses in power. This associates the rune with a thematically
appropriate english word.

Once you know all the runes in a spell and have them available,
the recipe appears automatically. (Guess-the-spell is not so fun.)

The "negate" rune, once identified, can also be used (consumed)
to change another identified rune into its opposite (assuming it
has one and only one). If the opposite is not identified, this
process identifies it.
