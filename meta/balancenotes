Culargottes can create unwinnable situations rather early -- should not be on level 1?
 definitely not.
Even snifflers are hard to deal with with absolutely no spells.
One-time escape charms?
However, taking down a sniffler can be down with 1 HP loss -- quite survivable.


 _do_ have visible trapdoors (holes) on levels 1-3, in case the exit is blocked

The cure to snifflers is walking through doors and closing them?

Trapdoors are both good and bad.

A bit more healing essences would be good, and magic scrolls.

Bomber beetles can be outrun.

Do rooks not work anymore? Test
No, they're not working.
