Culargottes can create unwinnable situations rather early -- should not be on level 1?
 definitely not.
Even snifflers are hard to deal with with absolutely no spells.

 _do_ have visible trapdoors (holes) on levels 1-3, in case the exit is blocked

Trapdoors are both good and bad.

A bit more healing essences would be good, and magic scrolls.

Bomber beetles can be outrun.

Do rooks not work anymore? Test
No, they're not working.

It's easy to bump into an ufflian whelp.. a bit evil, this.
