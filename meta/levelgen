an algorithm based on rooms

after rooms themselves, generated use classification to populate:
    the room with the up-stairs is the entry room
    select a few rooms as danger rooms, with traps and obstacles
        -rivers (water, lava)
        -outgoing doors hidden
    rooms that are hidden behind dangers rooms may be selected
    as
        -treasure rooms, with more treasure than normal
        -exit room, with the down-stairs
    

choose entry room
do dijkstra, (a room is 1 unit)
choose most distant, select.
do dijkstra again with the new as origin.
repea generating an ordering of rooms (non-entry)
first room is exit room
the next few are reward rooms
all other rooms are danger rooms (environment traps)

monsters are placed everywhere 
mostly-worthless loot is also placed everywhere
    (notably, empty chests -- can't recognize a
     reward room on sight)
