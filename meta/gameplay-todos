gameplay beginning to favour the player
requires:
    dangerous monsters <- exciting
    winnability <- boring
    books to identify runes <- so-so
    talismans of luck and health <- so-so
    treasure generation code <- boring [X]
    boulders <- so-so
    more spells <- exciting
    spell menu <- boring [X]
    weight limit <- boring [X]

also
    graceful handling of death <- boring [X]
    main menu <- boring [X]

BORING STUFF FIRST: good strategy
boring left: winnability
    also treasure gen
    winnability will wait, I'm not sure how to structure it in terms
     of plot. can always just go for "reach dungeon level n"
     in an emergency. (obviously it won't be "kill X".
     "retrieve Y" seems boring since monsters are one-off generated
     "reach doodad" -- portal home?

fun times so-so/bore ordering:
    treasure gen
    monster gen! how could I forget -- use same algo
    books
    talismans
    put everything in chests
    boulders
    monsters
    more spells
