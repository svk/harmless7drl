gameplay beginning to favour the player
requires:
    dangerous monsters <- exciting
    winnability <- boring
    books to identify runes <- so-so
    talismans of luck and health <- so-so
    treasure generation code <- boring
    boulders <- so-so
    more spells <- exciting
    spell menu <- boring

also
    graceful handling of death <- boring
    main menu <- boring
