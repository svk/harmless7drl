Trap: door slams shut
    As you walk through a door, it slams shut behind you - convert to (diggable)
    wall tile.

    Counter: always keep digging or teleporting tools or spells available

Obstacle: floor half missing
    The floor of a room is cut across by a wide hole in the floor.

    Moving into the hole acts as a trapdoor; bringing you to a random
    point on the level below. Will take some damage.

    Counter: levitate over the hole, or use it to descend faster

Obstacle: floor half spike pit
    The floor of a room is cut across by a wide spike pit.

    Moving into the hole means instant death.

    Counter: levitate over the hole, or walk around, or roll
             boulders into the pit to make a bridge

Obstacle: floor half water
    The floor of a room is cut across by a wide pool of water, guarded by
    water monsters (piranhas or piranhalikes?).

    Counter: levitate over the water, freeze it and walk over, walk around,
             grin and bear it and swim over
