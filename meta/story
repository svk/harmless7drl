The player needs to retrieve an object and return it to the surface.
It is a sentient, malicious artifact which might harm people if it
is allowed to go unchecked, and the player (an apprentice in a magical
institution) has allowed it to escape into a magical portal by
carelessness (neglecting duties to look after it).

The artifact is rather cutesy and is not directly threatening, but
somehow indirectly. It is an immortal random-walker in the deep
dungeons; when the player bumps into it they pacify it by some known
spell (since they were the artifact's minder, they know this), and
it turns into an item. However, just before this it "glares angrily"
at the player and more dangerous monsters are spawned on all the
shallower levels (to avoid a boring ascent).
