    == CONCEPT ==
This is a game about surviving by using your abilities
cleverly. Direct hack-and-slash approaches are probably
doomed to failure (though you are welcome to try as a
challenge game).

    == ABOUT THE SOURCE ==
The source is freely available, but if you want to play
the game unspoiled (which might lead to the best play
experience, since the game is at least partly one of
discovery), you should stay away from certain source
files until you have played for a while.

These files are marked with comments in the first few
lines.

Note also that this is hardly exemplary code, having
been written under a strict time limit.

    == ABOUT ROGUELIKES ==
Roguelikes with traditional interfaces (like this one)
can be daunting to first-time players. If you have not
played any other roguelikes (games like NetHack or ADOM),
reading the "Instructions" on the main menu may be
of help in comprehending how the game works.

    == DEVELOPMENT TIME ==

This game was coded entirely in 168 hours starting from
18:00 on Sunday March 7 2010, UTC+1. It was an entry
in the 2010 7DRL challenge.

    == THINGS I'VE LEARNED DURING THE CODING OF THIS GAME ==

 -Learning Haskell really changes your Python code.
 -WCurses (the Python curses port for Windows) is not
  terribly great.
 -But libtcod is pretty good. I can't imagine ever hacking
  up an ASCII window in SDL for a 7DRL ever again.
 -Tea tastes a great deal better when it's fresh.
 -Being restricted to the curses standard colours is hell
  on UI designers.
 -Cerealizer is pretty neat!
 -..but looking at the uncompressed stream in a hex editor
  really makes you wonder about it.
 -I'll never be able to get Spiral FOV right on the first
  try.
 -Sometimes, it might be better to have separate classes
  for boulders, monsters and player objects. (This is
  advice I did not actually take with this project.)
 -With an average height of 16 inches and a weight of 2
  pounds, the little blue penguin is the smallest of all
  18 species of penguins. [Thanks to an educational site
  for 4th to 6th graders for that one.]
 -git is pretty useful, and not just as a dev-log writing
  tool.
 -Random brainstorming tends to be more effective with
  just pen and paper than with the code in front of you.
 -Working on Windows is tolerable as long as you can
  stay within PuTTY for all your work.
 -Going back to Python 2.5 string formatting after getting
  used to the 2.6 way is painful.
 -Py2Exe binaries don't actually need to be tens of
  megabytes!
 -Freeze is.. not a realistic alternative. Terribly sorry
  to people who want binaries for Mac/Linux.
 -Writing lists for the README during dev time is a form
  of procrastination.
